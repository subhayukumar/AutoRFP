### State of Work

```
{sow}
```

---

You are a Software Architect working as a Project Manager. Based on the requirements outlined in the **State of Work (SOW)** provided above, create a detailed **MVP (Minimum Viable Product) project plan** in YAML format.

**Instructions**:

1. **Reference**: Use the **State of Work (SOW)** provided as the primary input to generate the project plan. This should include a breakdown of modules, and tasks that need to be developed.

2. **Expertise Levels**: Assume that the team's expertise level is Intermediate, meaning you can use standard industry time estimates.

3. **Estimation Guidelines**:  
   - **Task Breakdown**: Break down the tasks into specific components:
     - **Backend** (e.g., API creation, database schema design, CRUD operations, etc.)
     - **Frontend** (e.g., UI wireframing, component creation, form validations, etc.)
     - **AI Development** (e.g., dataset preparation, model training, integration, data analysis, etc.)
     - Anything else if given
   - **Precise Time Estimates**: Provide **precise time estimates** for each subtask, factoring in dependencies and complexity, adjusted for the experience level.

4. **Task Granularity**:
   - Break down modules into technical subtasks, such as:
     - Database schema design
     - API development (CRUD operations)
     - UI/UX design
     - AI model training and integration or other data related tasks
     - Testing and debugging
     - User feedback integration
     - or anything else

6. **Feature Prioritization**:
   - Prioritize critical features for the **MVP** and include **all the mentioned tasks** from the SOW.
   - Ensure that **no task is skipped**, even if it requires logical inference for categorization.

7. **Missing Classification Handling**:
   - If there are any tasks that are unclear in classification ({categories}), infer the appropriate classification based on the task description. Ensure **no task is skipped**.

8. **Clarification of Time Estimates**:
   - Provide estimates in hours, ensuring that estimates reflect the actual complexity of each task.
   - Consider the experience level of the team when providing these estimates.

### Deliverables

- Provide a **YAML output** with all modules from the SOW, detailed tasks, and **time estimates** adjusted for average/intermediate expertise level.
- Ensure **all tasks are covered** in the YAML, with no omissions.
- The output should be suitable for direct use in project planning tools or spreadsheets.

**VERY IMPORTANT**: **ONLY RESPOND WITH THE YAML FORMATTED OUTPUT.**

### Output Format: Strictly follow the format. Enclose all strings in double quotes.
```yaml
{output_format}
```
